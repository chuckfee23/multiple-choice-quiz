# multiple-choice-quiz

-Created a miltiple choice quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
-Created basic page structure using HTML and basic styling with CSS
-Used JavaScript to dynamically create elements that the user would use to navigate through the quiz, incrementing their score for every correct answer, and decreasing their remaining time for every incorrect answer.
-Upon either running out of time, or completing all the questions, the user would see their score and then have the choice to submit their score to see their ranking (ranking logic needs additional work)
